### Install
```sh
// YARN
yarn add simplelightbox

//Bower
bower install simplelightbox

//NPM
npm install simplelightbox
```

After that include simple-lightbox(.min).css and simple-lightbox(.min).js to your page.

### Usage
When using the standalone variant (`simple-lightbox(.min).js`)
```javascript
new SimpleLightbox('.some-element a', { /* options */ });
```

The jquery-compatible (`simple-lightbox.jquery(.min).js`) variant works as before (v1.x):
```javascript
$('.some-element a').simpleLightbox({ /* options */ });
```

### Markup
For the default setup, you just need links that are pointing to images.
```markup
<div class="gallery">
    <a href="images/image1.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb1.jpg" alt="" title=""/></a>
    <a href="images/image2.jpg"><img src="images/thumbs/thumb2.jpg" alt="" title="Beautiful Image"/></a>
</div>
```
The markup inside the A-Tags can be whatever you want. In this example thumbnails of the big images. The Title Tag is by default used to show a caption.
For a whole example just look at the demo folder.
